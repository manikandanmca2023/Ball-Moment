Ball-Moment
      
      
      This HTML and JavaScript code snippet creates a simple web page with a red ball that moves within a defined boundary. Here's a brief description of the code:
>HTML Structure:
      The <title> tag sets the title of the web page, which is currently set to "Document."
>Ball Container:
      Inside the <body>, there's a <div> element with the id "ball." This <div> represents the red ball.
      It has inline CSS styling to set its appearance, including a red background color, position (absolute), size (100x100 pixels), and initial position (top: 100px, left: 100px).
>JavaScript:
      The <script> tag contains JavaScript code.
      Variables varx and vary are initialized to 200, representing the horizontal and vertical movement distances for the ball.
      If the ball reaches the boundaries defined by x1, x2, y1, or y2, the direction is reversed using dir1 and dir2.
      Finally, the function updates the ball's position by setting its left and top CSS properties.
>setInterval:
      setInterval is used to repeatedly call the move function at regular intervals (every 1000 milliseconds or 1 second).
      This creates the effect of the ball moving within the specified boundaries
